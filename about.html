	<!-- About me -->

		<h1 style="color:#66645e">About Me</h1>
		<br>

		<p>Hi, I'm currently a fourth year student at University of California, Los Angeles studying Computer Science and Engineering.  I discovered my love for Computer Science during the summer between middle school and high school while attending a camp run by Google - CAPE.  CAPE taught us the basics of coding using Scratch and Processing (while also feeding us delicious food and giving us tons of prizes).  Since then, my passion for Computer Science and the possibilities it brings has only grown.
			<br>
			<br>
		Currently my plan is to graduate June of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science.
			<br>
			<br>
		Outside of building programs, I also like to explore all sorts of fields, from editing photos with Photoshop to editing vidoes with Sony Vegas to trying to write my own novels.  I especially love music and playing around with FL Studios and Audacity, with a goal of hopefully dropping a track someday.  I also love and play most multiplayer video games including League of Legends, CSGO, Starcraft II, Overwatch, Fortnite, and many more.  I regularly go to the gym and regularly skip leg day.
